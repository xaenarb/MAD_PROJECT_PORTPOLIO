lab2 reflection

In Lab 2, I explored Android UI design by constructing a login interface using a LinearLayout to stack an ImageView, EditText fields, and a Button.
 I learned how to configure specific XML attributes for different input types and gained practical experience linking these UI components to the backend 
Java logic using findViewById. This lab reinforced my understanding of how 
to handle user interaction and initialize views programmatically.
