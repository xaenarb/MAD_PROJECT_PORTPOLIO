reflection 1
In this lab I created a simple greeting application to learn
 how to make an Android UI interactive.
 I learned how to use findViewById to link XML objects to 
Java and used OnClickListener to respond to button clicks. 
I learned how to read the user's input from an EditText and 
display a customized Toast message in response.
