In Lab 4, I learned how to build a precise user interface using ConstraintLayout
 and Guidelines to align input fields for book details like title and price. I also practiced Object-Oriented Programming by
 creating a Book model class with constructors, getters,
 and setters to structure the data within my Android application.
