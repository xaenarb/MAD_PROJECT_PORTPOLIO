lab3 reflection
In Lab 3, I built a calculator application by organizing the UI with nested LinearLayouts 
and layout weights.
I learned to implement the View.OnClickListener interface
to handle multiple button events efficiently in a single method. 
This experience deepened my understanding of Android
UI composition and event handling.
